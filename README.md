# Caterpillar-Game
A simple game where you play as a hungry caterpillar and want to turn into a butterfly by eating various foods, each with different effects. 
This was done as an assignment for McGill's COMP250.

## My Part
I designed the logic for the caterpillar and the food, so everything that is not inside the subfolder "game".
